      "question": "An insurance agent recommends a permanent life insurance policy to a client. The agent will earn a significantly higher commission on this policy compared to a term policy. The agent believes the permanent policy may benefit the client in the long term, but does not disclose the commission difference.\n\nWhat is the agent's primary ethical failure?",
      "options": [
        "A. Recommending permanent insurance instead of term",
        "B. Failing to act in the client's best interest",
        "C. Failing to disclose a potential conflict of interest",
        "D. Earning a higher commission"

        "Recommending permanent coverage can be suitable in some cases; the ethical issue isn’t the product type by itself.",

        "A. The policy remains valid because the omission was unintentional",
        "B. The insurer may void the policy for material misrepresentation",
