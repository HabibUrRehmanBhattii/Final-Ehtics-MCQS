Likewise, Donald's settlement is not considered taxable income. Instead, it should be thought of as a settlement for an injured shoulder and back that now prevent him from enjoying certain aspects of life, including the ability to work.",

He answered \"No\" to all of the applicable health-related questions and submitted the first monthly premium along with the application. At the time, he was provided with a temporary insurance agreement (TIA) that provided him with interim coverage during the underwriting process. The TIA covered him for the lesser of $100,000 or the amount for which he was applying under the main policy. A few days later, the initial premium was returned for non-sufficient funds (NSF) from Joshua's financial institution.\nWhat impact would this have on the TIA?",

His risk tolerance would likely cause Joseph to not meet his goal of retirement at age 55. Victor placed Joseph's portfolio in a high-risk equity fund knowing it would pay him a higher commission, but he was confident that, in time, it would generate a return that would be higher than with a lower-risk fund.

As part of their separation agreement, Jules is required to pay Amanda $5,000 per month in spousal support as well as child support in accordance with provincial child support guidelines. Their child is only two years old, and therefore Jules will likely have to pay child support for 20-plus years.
