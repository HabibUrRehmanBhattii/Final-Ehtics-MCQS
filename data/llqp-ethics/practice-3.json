The purchase price was $525,000, and they were able to make a down payment of $125,000. At the time of purchase, Franco, the mortgage advisor at Big Bank, advised them to purchase mortgage insurance through the bank, which would pay out the outstanding mortgage balance in the event that Danielle or Dustin dies before the loan has been fully repaid. They agreed. The premium will be paid in conjunction with their mortgage payments and will add $85 to the amount that is debited from their account twice per month. Sunny is an independent, licensed life insurance agent. He met with Danielle and Dustin to discuss their life insurance needs and learned about the creditor insurance that they have in place with Big Bank. He suggested that a renewable convertible (RC) T-10 policy from one of the companies that they can contract with would be more appropriate and likely cheaper.

      "explanation": "When replacing any policy, it is a critical ethical and professional standard to ensure the new coverage is fully approved and in force before canceling the existing policy to avoid any gap in protection.\n\nKEY DETAILS FROM THE SCENARIO:\n\n• Creditor insurance premium: $85 × 2 per month = $170/month\n• Sunny's RC T-10 policy: $100/month (significantly cheaper)\n• The RC T-10 is renewable (can be renewed without new medical evidence) and convertible (can be changed to permanent insurance)\n\nWHY OPTION A IS WRONG:\nMany candidates misread the premium structure. The $85 is debited TWICE per month, making the total $170/month — not $85. Sunny's $100/month policy is clearly cheaper.\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\nAn RC T-10 policy renews every 10 years and can also be converted to permanent insurance, making it perfectly suitable for a mortgage that exceeds 10 years.\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG:\nTied selling occurs when obtaining one product (the mortgage) is conditional on purchasing another (the insurance). Franco merely \"advised\" them — he did not require it as a condition of the mortgage.\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nNote 1 - Critical Policy Replacement Rule:\nWhen replacing a policy, it is critical to ensure that the clients are approved for the new policy before they cancel the old one. Otherwise, the clients could be left with no insurance if the new policy is not approved for some reason.\n\nNote 2 - Not Tied Selling:\nThis is not a case of tied selling. Nothing in the scenario suggests that Franco made the purchase of Big Bank's mortgage insurance a condition of getting the mortgage. He simply recommended that Danielle and Dustin purchase the policy from Big Bank, but they would have been free to get the required insurance from any source.\n\nNote 3 - Cost Comparison:\nThe premium for the policy from Big Bank is $85 twice per month, which equates to $170 per month. This is much more expensive than the policy that Sunny is recommending.\n\nNote 4 - Policy Features:\nThe policy that Sunny is recommending is renewable and convertible, so it could be renewed for as long as is required to cover the mortgage.",

An individual could be the beneficiary on a policy without even knowing that the policy exists.\n\nKey Point 3 - Legal Constraints:\nIn some cases, a separation agreement could prevent a policyholder from changing the beneficiary even if the former spouse were listed as a revocable beneficiary.\n\nKey Point 4 - Formal Requirements:\nThe naming of a beneficiary must be in writing; however, from a legal perspective, the designation can take place either with the insurer directly or through the insured's last will and testament.",

Peter's beneficiaries have all predeceased him, so his primary concern is taking care of himself. The whole life policy does not have accelerated death benefits, so he is unable to receive a payout until his death. With the help of his agent, he was able to find an investor who was willing to purchase the policy.

This is specifically prohibited in jurisdictions like Ontario and generally discouraged by the insurance industry.\n\nWHAT IS TRAFFICKING IN INSURANCE?\n\nTrafficking in insurance occurs when:\n• A policyholder sells their policy to a third-party investor\n• The sale price is more than the cash surrender value\n• The sale price is less than the death benefit\n• The transaction benefits the investor more than the original policyholder\n\nWHY THIS IS PROBLEMATIC:\n\nThe scenario illustrates the core ethical issue: Peter receives $250,000 now from his policy worth $1,000,000 at death. However, an investor purchases it at this discounted rate and stands to make approximately $750,000 when Peter dies—potentially within just a few years. This creates a questionable incentive structure.\n\nWHY OPTION B IS WRONG:\nTied selling involves making the purchase of one product a condition for obtaining another (e.g., \"buy mortgage insurance to get the mortgage\"). This scenario describes a policy sale to a third party, which is trafficking, not tied selling.\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\nA Life Insurance Replacement Declaration (LIRD) is used for replacing one insurance policy with another from the same policyholder.

An investor stands to profit $920,000 from their death. Does this seem like the client was taken advantage of?

Michael's daughter inherits his share.\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\nThe death of a beneficiary does not invalidate the entire will. Statutory anti-lapse rules or \"gift-over\" provisions in the will determine how that beneficiary's share is redistributed. The will remains valid.\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG:\nSection 31 specifically distributes the gift as if the child had died intestate AFTER the testator. This means Michael's share goes directly to his daughter, bypassing Michael's own will entirely. This protects the grandchild's inheritance.\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - General Rule:\nIn order for a beneficiary to be valid, he or she must be alive at the time of the testator's death. Michael pre-deceased Olga, and therefore his estate would normally have no entitlement.\n\nKey Point 2 - The Rationale (Illustrated Example):\nConsider this scenario: Chuck loved his sister Grace but despised her husband Bobby. Despite this, he named Grace as the sole beneficiary in his $1,000,000 life insurance policy. Grace died a few days before Chuck.\n\nIf the beneficiary designation remained valid:\n• The proceeds would be paid to Grace's estate\n• Then likely left to her husband Bobby (as per Grace's will)\n• This would NOT have been Chuck's intentions\n\nBecause the beneficiary designation is no longer valid:\n• The proceeds will be paid to Chuck's estate\n• Be distributed according to Chuck's last will and testament (not Grace's)\n\nThis illustrates why beneficiaries must be alive—BUT the anti-lapse provision for children with surviving issue creates an important exception to protect grandchildren.",

It is entirely possible that the deceased's debts exceed his or her assets, essentially bankrupting the estate and leaving no assets available for the named beneficiaries.\n\nKey Point 2 - Life Insurance Protection:\nProvincial insurance legislation states that insurance proceeds payable to protected class beneficiaries (spouse, child, grandchild, etc.) do not form part of the deceased's estate. Jake was named as beneficiary in the policy itself; therefore, the insurer would pay the $500,000 death benefit directly to Jake.\n\nKey Point 3 - Insolvent Estate Result:\nCarlos's remaining estate assets are not sufficient to cover his outstanding debts; therefore, Jake can expect to receive nothing further as a beneficiary of the estate (though he does receive the insurance proceeds).",
