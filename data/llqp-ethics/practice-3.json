      "question": "Elaine, age 72, wants to purchase a deferred life insurance policy to provide an inheritance for her grandchildren. She has some mild cognitive impairment, and her adult daughter is helping her complete the paperwork. During the application, Elaine occasionally forgets details about her health history. The agent notices this but continues the application without formally assessing Elaine’s understanding of the contract.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the agent’s obligations?",
      "options": [
        "A. Proceeding with the application is acceptable because Elaine’s daughter is assisting.",
        "B. The agent must ensure Elaine understands the contract and delay or stop the transaction if necessary.",
        "C. Cognitive impairment is not relevant as long as premiums are paid.",
        "D. The agent may rely solely on information from the daughter for disclosure."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Vulnerable client + incomplete understanding = duty to protect. Assistance from family does not replace informed consent.",

      "question": "Roberto, a licensed agent, has agreed to share part of his commission with a local mortgage broker for every client referral. He does not inform the clients of this arrangement. One of the clients later claims that the policy recommended was more expensive than necessary.\n\nWhat is the regulatory and ethical concern in this situation?",
      "options": [
        "A. The referral arrangement is irrelevant because the client agreed to purchase.",
        "B. The undisclosed financial relationship constitutes a conflict of interest.",
        "C. The agent is allowed to share commission without disclosure if the policy suits the client.",
        "D. The issue only arises if the referral fee exceeds 15% of the premium."

      "correctAnswer": 1,

      "question": "Martha is replacing her existing term life insurance with a permanent policy. The replacement will increase her premiums and restart the suicide and contestability periods. The agent explains some benefits verbally but does not clearly explain the reset periods. Martha signs the application.\n\nWhich statement is correct?",
      "options": [
        "A. Replacement is acceptable because Martha consented.",
        "B. The agent committed an ethical violation due to incomplete disclosure of material disadvantages.",

        "D. The replacement is valid as long as the new features are superior."
