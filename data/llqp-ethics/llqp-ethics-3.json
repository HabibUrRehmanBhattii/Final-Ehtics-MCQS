The purchase price was $525,000, and they were able to make a down payment of $125,000. At the time of purchase, Franco, the mortgage advisor at Big Bank, advised them to purchase mortgage insurance through the bank, which would pay out the outstanding mortgage balance in the event that Danielle or Dustin dies before the loan has been fully repaid. They agreed. The premium will be paid in conjunction with their mortgage payments and will add $85 to the amount that is debited from their account twice per month. Sunny is an independent, licensed life insurance agent. He met with Danielle and Dustin to discuss their life insurance needs and learned about the creditor insurance that they have in place with Big Bank. He suggested that a renewable convertible (RC) T-10 policy from one of the companies that they can contract with would be more appropriate and likely cheaper.

      "explanation": "When replacing any policy, it is a critical ethical and professional standard to ensure the new coverage is fully approved and in force before canceling the existing policy to avoid any gap in protection.\n\nKEY DETAILS FROM THE SCENARIO:\n\n• Creditor insurance premium: $85 × 2 per month = $170/month\n• Sunny's RC T-10 policy: $100/month (significantly cheaper)\n• The RC T-10 is renewable (can be renewed without new medical evidence) and convertible (can be changed to permanent insurance)\n\nWHY OPTION A IS WRONG:\nMany candidates misread the premium structure. The $85 is debited TWICE per month, making the total $170/month — not $85. Sunny's $100/month policy is clearly cheaper.\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\nAn RC T-10 policy renews every 10 years and can also be converted to permanent insurance, making it perfectly suitable for a mortgage that exceeds 10 years.\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG:\nTied selling occurs when obtaining one product (the mortgage) is conditional on purchasing another (the insurance). Franco merely \"advised\" them — he did not require it as a condition of the mortgage.\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nNote 1 - Critical Policy Replacement Rule:\nWhen replacing a policy, it is critical to ensure that the clients are approved for the new policy before they cancel the old one. Otherwise, the clients could be left with no insurance if the new policy is not approved for some reason.\n\nNote 2 - Not Tied Selling:\nThis is not a case of tied selling. Nothing in the scenario suggests that Franco made the purchase of Big Bank's mortgage insurance a condition of getting the mortgage. He simply recommended that Danielle and Dustin purchase the policy from Big Bank, but they would have been free to get the required insurance from any source.\n\nNote 3 - Cost Comparison:\nThe premium for the policy from Big Bank is $85 twice per month, which equates to $170 per month. This is much more expensive than the policy that Sunny is recommending.\n\nNote 4 - Policy Features:\nThe policy that Sunny is recommending is renewable and convertible, so it could be renewed for as long as is required to cover the mortgage.",

Peter's beneficiaries have all predeceased him, so his primary concern is taking care of himself. The whole life policy does not have accelerated death benefits, so he is unable to receive a payout until his death.

This is specifically prohibited in jurisdictions like Ontario and generally discouraged by the insurance industry.\n\nWHAT IS TRAFFICKING IN INSURANCE?\n\nTrafficking in insurance occurs when:\n• A policyholder sells their policy to a third-party investor\n• The sale price is more than the cash surrender value\n• The sale price is less than the death benefit\n• The transaction benefits the investor more than the original policyholder\n\nWHY THIS IS PROBLEMATIC:\n\nThe scenario illustrates the core ethical issue: Peter receives $250,000 now from his policy worth $1,000,000 at death. However, an investor purchases it at this discounted rate and stands to make approximately $750,000 when Peter dies—potentially within just a few years. This creates a questionable incentive structure.\n\nWHY OPTION B IS WRONG:\nTied selling involves making the purchase of one product a condition for obtaining another (e.g., \"buy mortgage insurance to get the mortgage\").

An investor stands to profit $920,000 from their death. Does this seem like the client was taken advantage of?

Michael's daughter inherits his share.\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\nThe death of a beneficiary does not invalidate the entire will. Statutory anti-lapse rules or \"gift-over\" provisions in the will determine how that beneficiary's share is redistributed. The will remains valid.\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG:\nSection 31 specifically distributes the gift as if the child had died intestate AFTER the testator. This means Michael's share goes directly to his daughter, bypassing Michael's own will entirely. This protects the grandchild's inheritance.\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - General Rule:\nIn order for a beneficiary to be valid, he or she must be alive at the time of the testator's death. Michael pre-deceased Olga, and therefore his estate would normally have no entitlement.\n\nKey Point 2 - The Rationale (Illustrated Example):\nConsider this scenario: Chuck loved his sister Grace but despised her husband Bobby. Despite this, he named Grace as the sole beneficiary in his $1,000,000 life insurance policy. Grace died a few days before Chuck.\n\nIf the beneficiary designation remained valid:\n• The proceeds would be paid to Grace's estate\n• Then likely left to her husband Bobby (as per Grace's will)\n• This would NOT have been Chuck's intentions\n\nBecause the beneficiary designation is no longer valid:\n• The proceeds will be paid to Chuck's estate\n• Be distributed according to Chuck's last will and testament (not Grace's)\n\nThis illustrates why beneficiaries must be alive—BUT the anti-lapse provision for children with surviving issue creates an important exception to protect grandchildren.",

A collateral assignment does not transfer ownership; it only provides a security interest or claim against the proceeds to secure a debt. An absolute assignment would be required to actually change the policy owner. Betty remains the owner.\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\nThe cash surrender value ($12,000) is what the policy owner can access while alive by surrendering (canceling) the policy. Upon death, the death benefit is triggered, not the CSV. The bank's claim is against the death benefit ($150,000), not the CSV. The bank receives the loan balance ($45,000), not the CSV.\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG:\nWhile a spouse may belong to a \"protected class\" (meaning insurance proceeds to spouses are typically protected from creditors), the policy owner (Betty) waived that protection for the portion of the debt when she voluntarily signed the collateral assignment. The bank has priority for the debt amount.\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - Protected Class Protection is Waived:\nWhile a spouse is part of the protected class, that protection was waived when Betty signed the collateral assignment. By voluntarily assigning the policy as collateral, Betty gave the bank a secured claim against the death benefit for the amount of the loan.\n\nKey Point 2 - Revocable vs. Irrevocable Matters:\nBetty's husband cannot dispute the assignment because he was named as a revocable beneficiary, not an irrevocable beneficiary. A revocable beneficiary has no vested rights and cannot prevent the policy owner from making changes or assignments.\n\nKey Point 3 - Payment Priority:\nThe death benefit would be used to pay the bank the amount owed under the loan FIRST, with the remainder being paid to Betty's husband as the named beneficiary. The order is:\n1. Bank receives the debt amount ($45,000)\n2. Beneficiary receives the remainder ($105,000)\n\nKey Point 4 - CSV is Irrelevant at Death:\nThe $12,000 cash surrender value is completely irrelevant in this calculation. CSV only matters if the policy is surrendered while the insured is alive. At death, the full death benefit is paid out.",

However:\n• The policy is being surrendered, not claimed as a death benefit\n• Face amount is irrelevant for cash value protection\n• This doesn't correspond to any Assuris protection formula for cash value\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\n$60,000 was the previous fixed limit for health insurance cash value protection before Assuris increased coverage levels. It's an outdated number and doesn't apply to this scenario or current Assuris rules.\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG:\n$200,000 was a previous limit for death benefit protection under Assuris (85% or $200,000, whichever is less). However:\n• This is NOT a death benefit claim\n• Justin is surrendering for cash value\n• Death benefit protection formulas don't apply here\n\nASSURIS PROTECTION SUMMARY:\n\nDEATH BENEFIT:\n• 85% of death benefit OR $200,000 (whichever is less)\n\nCASH VALUE:\n• 90% of cash value OR $100,000 (whichever is GREATER)\n• Note: For amounts under $111,111, you'd get 100% up to $100,000\n• For amounts over $111,111, you get 90%\n\nDISABILITY INCOME:\n• 85% of benefit OR $5,000/month (whichever is less)\n\nHEALTH INSURANCE:\n• 85% of benefit OR $60,000 (whichever is less)\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - Reading Comprehension is Critical:\nMartin was not the life-insured (his business partner was), and therefore the death benefit was not payable upon his death. We know this because, when Martin died, instead of the death benefit being payable, ownership of the policy transitioned to the contingent policy owner.\n\nKey Point 2 - This is About Cash Value, Not Death Benefit:\nTherefore, this question is referring to Assuris's coverage on the cash value as opposed to the death benefit itself.\n\nKey Point 3 - The Cash Value Formula:\nIn terms of the cash value, Assuris covers the GREATER of:\n• 100% of the cash value up to $100,000, OR\n• 90% of the cash value\n\nCalculation:\n$210,000 cash value × 90% = $189,000\n\n🧠 EXAM KILL-SWITCH RULE:\n\nIf you see:\n• Insurer bankrupt\n• Policy surrendered\n• Cash value mentioned\n\nYour brain must jump to: \"90% of cash value.\"\n\nFace amount is a distraction.

On the other hand, Brooks's wife Amanda does not believe in the supernatural and laughed it off. Knowing his neighbour was experiencing financial difficulties, Nathaniel approached Brooks's wife with a proposal a few days later. She has an insurable interest in her husband's life and could therefore purchase a life insurance policy on him.

      "explanation": "This scenario is not really about insurable interest timing — that's the bait. The real issue is INTENT and STRUCTURE. An inducement to apply for new life insurance and then assign ownership to another party in exchange for payment is a form of trafficking in insurance. Many Canadian jurisdictions prohibit this practice outright, and it is universally discouraged by the industry.\n\nSTEP 1: YES, INSURABLE INTEREST TECHNICALLY EXISTS (but don't stop there)\n\n• Amanda (wife) does have an insurable interest in her husband Brooks\n• So the policy can be validly issued in her name\n• This is where weak candidates stop thinking. The exam doesn't.\n\nSTEP 2: LOOK AT THE PLAN (this is where it goes bad)\n\nNathaniel's proposal is:\n• Policy issued to wife ✅\n• Immediate or planned absolute assignment to Nathaniel ❌\n• Nathaniel has NO insurable interest in Brooks\n• Purpose = financial gain from another person's death\n\n👉 This is a textbook setup for trafficking in insurance.\n\nSTEP 3: WHY AGENTS MUST BE CONCERNED\n\nTrafficking in insurance involves:\n• Policies taken out for the benefit of third parties\n• Third parties who lack insurable interest\n• Arrangements designed from the outset to transfer ownership\n• Exchange of money for the policy assignment\n\nEven if technically legal in some jurisdictions, it is:\n• Specifically prohibited in some (like Ontario)\n• Strongly discouraged everywhere\n• A major red flag for agents under E&O and ethics rules\n\nWHY OPTION A IS WRONG:\n\"Nothing... insurable interest need only exist at the time the policy is issued.\"\n\n• True in isolation\n• But ignores the pre-arranged assignment for payment\n• Exam trap: correct fact, wrong conclusion\n• Insurable interest timing is irrelevant when trafficking intent exists from the start\n\nWHY OPTION B IS WRONG:\n\"Nothing... insurable interest need only exist at the time the policy is applied for.\"\n\n• Same problem as Option A\n• Timing is irrelevant when trafficking intent exists\n• The validity of insurable interest at application does not override the prohibitions against subsequent sale of the policy for profit\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\n\"Assignment would not be valid because new owner lacked insurable interest.\"\n\n• Assignments can be valid even without insurable interest (e.g., gifts, sales)\n• That's not the legal flaw here\n• The flaw is ethical + regulatory (trafficking), not technical validity\n• In most jurisdictions, an assignee does not strictly need an insurable interest for a legitimate transfer, but the issue here is the \"inducement\" and exchange for payment\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - What is Trafficking:\nTrafficking in insurance is specifically prohibited in some jurisdictions and discouraged by the industry as a whole. An inducement to apply for new life insurance and then assign ownership of the policy to another party in exchange for payment is a form of trafficking insurance.\n\nKey Point 2 - Insurable Interest is a Distraction:\nWhile the learning point to this question has nothing to do with insurable interest, you should know that such interest only needs to exist at the time a policy is applied for and issued. The issue with the scenario is that the upfront intent was to purchase the policy and then assign it for a fee.\n\nKey Point 3 - The Pre-Arrangement is the Problem:\nThe problem isn't the assignment itself — it's that the arrangement was planned from the beginning. Nathaniel induced Amanda to take out the policy with the understanding that she would immediately assign it to him for payment. This transforms a legitimate insurance transaction into trafficking.\n\nKey Point 4 - Why This Matters:\n• Nathaniel has no insurable interest in Brooks\n• Nathaniel profits from Brooks's death\n• This creates a perverse incentive (financial gain from death)\n• It violates the fundamental principle of insurance: indemnification, not speculation\n\n🧠 EXAM KILL RULE:\n\nIf you see:\n• Stranger funding or buying a policy\n• Planned assignment to someone with no insurable interest\n• Profit motive tied to death\n• Pre-arranged transfer for payment\n\nYour answer is almost always: Trafficking in insurance\n\nThe dream story, the neighbour relationship, and the financial difficulties are all narrative distractions.

Doesn't that mean the CI claim is valid?\"\n\nNO. Technical eligibility ≠ valid claim when criminal activity is involved.\n\nThe survival period is irrelevant if the injury itself occurred during the commission of a crime.\n\n\"But what if an innocent person was the beneficiary?\"\n\nDoesn't matter. The exclusion applies to the CLAIM, not the beneficiary. If the insured person was committing a crime when the loss occurred, the policy doesn't pay — period.\n\n\"Isn't this harsh? What about their families?\"\n\nPublic policy is intentionally harsh to prevent people from using insurance as a \"safety net\" for criminal activity. The law will not allow insurance to become a tool for profiting from crime.\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - Public Policy Trumps Everything:\nUnder the principle of \"public policy,\" an insurer will not pay for loss or death that occurs while the insured is committing a criminal act. This applies even if all other policy conditions are met (coverage amount, survival periods, beneficiary designations, etc.).\n\nKey Point 2 - Criminal Activity Exclusions are Standard:\nAll insurance policies (life, CI, disability, property) contain exclusions for illegal acts or criminal activity. These are not optional — they reflect fundamental legal principles.\n\nKey Point 3 - Survival Period is Irrelevant:\nAlthough Clyde survived the 30-day CI waiting period (he died 45 days later), the injury was sustained during the commission of a crime (bank robbery and getaway). This nullifies both the life and CI claims, regardless of technical eligibility.\n\nKey Point 4 - No One Benefits from Crime:\nNeither the insured, their estate, nor their beneficiaries can profit from insurance when the loss occurred during criminal activity. This principle protects the integrity of the insurance system.\n\n🧠 EXAM MEMORY HOOK (CRITICAL):\n\nIf you see:\n• Robbery\n• Drug deal\n• Assault\n• Getaway\n• Crime explicitly described in the scenario\n\nYour brain should immediately say: \"Public policy → NO PAYOUT.\"\n\nEven if:\n• Survival period is met ✓\n• Condition is covered ✓\n• Beneficiary is innocent ✓\n\nCrime kills the claim.

Let the underwriter make the final decision\n\nWHY OPTION B IS WRONG:\n\"Record answers as provided.\"\n\n• While agents must act in the client's best interest, this approach violates duty of care\n• Recording a known or suspected false statement is a breach of the agent's fiduciary duty to the insurer\n• This facilitates misrepresentation\n• The claim can be denied or rescinded later when the truth comes out\n• \"Best interest\" does not mean helping someone commit fraud\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\n\"Should not comment due to coaching rules.\"\n\n• Misunderstands what \"coaching\" means\n• Coaching = telling the client what answer to give\n• Warning = explaining the consequences of providing false information\n• These are opposite actions\n• Clarifying the consequences of false disclosure is PART of the agent's duty to provide proper advice\n• It ensures the application is accurate\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG:\n\"Change the answer to smoker.\"\n\n• The agent must NEVER alter a client's answer without explicit consent\n• The client must initial any changes\n• Changing the answer without Michael's agreement is itself a form of misrepresentation\n• The correct process is:\n  1. Discuss with the client first\n  2. Give the client the chance to correct their own answer\n  3. Only then can a change be documented with client initials\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - Duty of Disclosure:\nBoth the insured and the agent have a duty to ensure the application contains complete and accurate information. Misrepresentation (providing false or incomplete information) can result in:\n• Policy rescission (cancellation from the beginning)\n• Claim denial\n• Policy cancellation\n\nKey Point 2 - The Agent's Role:\nThe agent must:\n• Educate the client on the importance of accuracy\n• Warn the client about consequences of misrepresentation\n• Document any inconsistencies or observations\n• Let the underwriter make the final determination\n\nKey Point 3 - What the Agent Must NOT Do:\n❌ Cannot change answers on the application without client consent and initials\n❌ Cannot ignore obvious inconsistencies\n❌ Cannot coach by telling the client what to answer\n❌ Cannot record false statements simply to \"help the client get approved\"\n\nKey Point 4 - Documentation is Critical:\nIf Michael maintains his non-smoker answer despite the agent's explanation of consequences, the agent MUST document their observations in the agent's report section of the application. This creates a record that:\n• The inconsistency was noted\n• The client was warned\n• The client chose to maintain their answer\n• This protects the agent and insurer later\n\nKey Point 5 - Duty to the Insurer:\nAgents have a fiduciary duty to the INSURER as well as the client. Recording a known or suspected false statement violates this duty and can result in:\n• The agent facing disciplinary action\n• The agent's license being suspended or revoked\n• Claims being denied when the truth emerges\n\n🧠 EXAM RULE TO MEMORIZE:\n\nWhen you suspect misrepresentation:\n\nWarn → Document → Let the client decide\n\nNever:\n❌ Guess\n❌ Alter\n❌ Ignore\n\nThe agent's job is to ensure accuracy and disclosure, not to help the client hide information or to make changes on the client's behalf. Education and documentation are your shields against liability.",

      "question": "(PPE-005) EPP\nGeorge is a successful life insurance agent. At the request of one of his most important clients, George met with the client's 20-year old daughter Grace to discuss purchasing a life insurance policy. After learning that Grace was newly married and expecting a child, George realized an immediate need for life insurance. In an effort to assist her in purchasing the needed coverage, he offered to give her part of his commission to help cover the initial premium.\n\nWas George's offer appropriate?",

        "Maybe. George's actions are permissible providing it is something he offers all potential clients.",

        null,
        "While the product may be suitable, the method of assisting with the premium (rebating) is unethical and illegal under insurance regulations."
      ],
      "explanation": "George's offer to give a portion of his commission to the client is known as rebating. In Canada, rebating is considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice and is strictly prohibited by provincial insurance regulators.\n\nSTEP 1: WHAT DID GEORGE DO?\n\n• Offered to give part of his commission\n• Purpose: help pay the initial premium\n• Given as an inducement to purchase insurance\n\nThat's the textbook definition of rebating.\n\nSTEP 2: WHAT IS REBATING?\n\nRebating is:\n• Offering cash, commission, gifts, or value\n• Not stated in the policy\n• To induce someone to buy insurance\n\n👉 It is considered:\n• Unfair\n• Deceptive\n• Prohibited in most jurisdictions\n• Intent does not matter\n• Good intentions do not save you\n\nWHY OPTION A IS WRONG:\n\"Maybe. Permissible if offered to similar demographics.\"\n\n• Misunderstands the rule\n• Non-discrimination rules ≠ rebating rules\n• You cannot rebate even if everyone in a demographic gets it\n• Rebating is prohibited REGARDLESS of consistency or fairness in application\n• The prohibited practice is the rebating itself, not the discrimination\n\nWHY OPTION B IS WRONG:\n\"Maybe. Permissible if offered to all potential clients.\"\n\n• Still rebating\n• Widespread illegality doesn't become legal\n• Just because everyone gets the rebate doesn't make it compliant\n• If George offered every single client a commission rebate, it would STILL be prohibited\n• The practice itself is the violation, not the selectivity\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG:\n\"Yes. George assisted in the purchase of a suitable insurance product.\"\n\n• Suitability of the product is irrelevant to the compliance issue\n• The product may be perfectly suitable for Grace's needs\n• But the METHOD of facilitating the purchase (rebating) is illegal\n• Providing a suitable product through prohibited means is still a violation\n• Two rights don't make a compliance issue right\n\nKEY DISTINCTIONS:\n\nWHAT IS ALLOWED:\n• Recommending appropriate coverage\n• Explaining the benefits of the policy\n• Helping the client understand their needs\n• Properly disclosing commission and fees\n\nWHAT IS NOT ALLOWED:\n❌ Giving back commission\n❌ Paying part of the premium\n❌ Offering cash incentives\n❌ Providing gifts as inducements\n❌ Any value offered to reduce the client's out-of-pocket cost\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - Intent Doesn't Matter:\nEven though George's intentions were good (helping Grace afford coverage for her young family), the practice of rebating is strictly prohibited. Regulators don't care about the \"why\" — they care about the \"what.\" Rebating is rebating, whether it's generous or unfair.\n\nKey Point 2 - Why Rebating is Prohibited:\nRebating is considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice because:\n• It can encourage clients to purchase unsuitable coverage\n• It distorts the true cost of insurance\n• It creates unfair competition (agents without rebate programs can't compete)\n• It can lead to over-insurance or under-insurance decisions\n• It violates the principle of transparency\n\nKey Point 3 - Prohibited Forms of Rebating:\nRebating can take many forms:\n• Cash given back to the client\n• Commission returned to the client\n• Gifts or merchandise offered as inducement\n• Paying the client's premium or part of it\n• Waiving fees or charges\n• Any other value offered to reduce the client's cost\n\nKey Point 4 - The Rule is Absolute:\nThere are no exceptions:\n• It doesn't matter if the policy is suitable\n• It doesn't matter if the client requested help\n• It doesn't matter if the agent is trying to be helpful\n• It doesn't matter if other agents do the same\n• Rebating is always prohibited\n\nKey Point 5 - Consequences:\nAgents who engage in rebating face:\n• License suspension or revocation\n• Fines\n• Disciplinary action\n• Criminal charges in some jurisdictions\n• Termination of employment\n• Reputational damage\n\n🧠 EXAM KILL RULE:\n\nIf you see:\n• Agent giving back commission\n• Helping pay premiums\n• Cash, gifts, or \"incentives\"\n• \"To help the client afford...\"\n• \"To encourage the client to purchase...\"\n\nYour answer is almost always: Rebating → prohibited\n\nKey Trigger Phrases:\n• \"Offered to give...\"\n• \"Help cover the premium...\"\n• \"Inducement to purchase...\"\n• \"Assist in affording...\"\n\nAll roads lead to rebating.\n\nThe fact that Grace is a new mom, newly married, and genuinely needs insurance is completely irrelevant.

      "question": "(PPE-013) EPP\nOn June 21, 2019, Benjamin was in the United States at a concert that had become the site of a terrorist attack. He has not been seen or heard from since the night of the concert, and it is looking as though he was killed. Benjamin had a life insurance policy that was in force on that date but has since lapsed due to non-payment of premium. In an effort to collect on his life insurance policy, his spouse, who is the named beneficiary in the policy, applied to the courts to have him declared dead.\n\nIf the courts declare Benjamin deceased, will the insurance policy pay the death benefit?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, since he was declared dead by the courts and the death occurred while the policy was in force.",
        "No, the insurance company will not make payment until Benjamin has been missing for seven years or the body has been located.",
        "No, since the cause of death is the direct result of an illegal activity.",

        "While a seven-year absence is a general rule for declaring someone dead, a court can declare someone deceased much sooner if there is strong evidence of immediate peril, such as a terrorist attack.",
        "Terrorism is an illegal activity committed against the insured, not by the insured. Being a victim of a crime does not trigger the criminal act exclusion.",
        "The date of the court declaration is not what determines coverage; rather, it is the established date of death relative to the policy's active status."
      ],
      "explanation": "If a court issues a declaration of death and establishes the date of death as the date the individual went missing (June 21, 2019), the claim is valid because the death occurred while the policy was in force. The subsequent lapse for non-payment of premium does not invalidate a claim for a death that happened prior to the lapse.\n\nTHIS QUESTION IS ALL ABOUT WHEN DEATH OCCURRED, NOT WHEN IT WAS DECLARED.\n\nSTEP 1: IDENTIFY THE KEY TIMELINE\n\n• Terrorist attack (presumed date of death): June 21, 2019\n• Policy status on that date: IN FORCE ✅\n• Policy later lapsed: due to non-payment\n• Court declaration of death: after the lapse\n\n👉 The declaration date is NOT the date of death. It is only legal confirmation of a death that already occurred.\n\nSTEP 2: PRESUMPTION OF DEATH RULE\n\nCourts can declare a person dead in two circumstances:\n\n1. After a long unexplained absence (typically 7 years), OR\n2. When disappearance occurs under circumstances of peril (e.g., terrorist attack, plane crash, shipwreck)\n\nOnce declared:\n• Death is deemed to have occurred at the time of the peril, NOT the court date\n• This is critical\n\nSTEP 3: APPLY IT TO THE POLICY\n\n• Death is deemed to have occurred on June 21, 2019\n• Policy was active on that date\n\n➡️ Death benefit is PAYABLE\n\n• Policy lapse AFTER death is irrelevant\n• The death benefit is owed for a death that occurred while coverage existed\n\nWHY OPTION B IS WRONG:\n\"No, must wait seven years or body found.\"\n\n• Seven-year rule applies to ordinary disappearances\n• Where there is no evidence of what happened\n• This was a specific peril event (terrorist attack)\n• Courts can declare death much earlier when there is evidence of immediate peril\n• Benjamin disappeared at a terrorist attack — immediate peril is established\n• The court can declare him dead without waiting 7 years\n• And death is deemed to have occurred on the date of the peril\n\nWHY OPTION C IS WRONG:\n\"No, since cause of death is the direct result of an illegal activity.\"\n\n• Terrorist attack ≠ insured committing an illegal act\n• Public policy exclusion applies when the INSURED commits the crime\n• Benjamin is a VICTIM of terrorism, not the perpetrator\n• Being a victim of a crime does not trigger the criminal act exclusion\n• The policy covers deaths from all causes except those specifically excluded\n• Being attacked by a terrorist is not an excluded cause\n\nWHY OPTION D IS WRONG (Common Trap):\n\"No, since his death was declared well after the policy lapsed.\"\n\n• This is the most common wrong answer\n• Confuses declaration date with date of death\n• Coverage depends on WHEN THE DEATH OCCURRED, not when it was legally declared\n• Death is presumed to have occurred on June 21, 2019 (the date of the terrorist attack)\n• On that date, the policy was in force\n• Therefore, the death benefit is payable\n• It doesn't matter that the policy later lapsed\n• You can't un-pay a death benefit by letting the policy lapse after the death already happened\n\nKEY PRINCIPLES:\n\n1. DATE OF DEATH vs. DATE OF DECLARATION\n   • Date of death = When the person died (or is presumed to have died)\n   • Date of declaration = When the court legally confirms the death\n   • These are usually different dates\n   • Policy coverage is determined by DATE OF DEATH, not declaration date\n\n2. PRESUMPTION OF DEATH FROM PERIL\n   • When someone disappears under circumstances of specific peril\n   • Death is PRESUMED to have occurred at the time of the peril\n   • Not 7 years later\n   • Not when the body is found\n   • At the time of the known peril event\n\n3. POLICY STATUS AT TIME OF DEATH\n   • What matters is whether the policy was in force when death occurred\n   • Not whether it's in force when the claim is made\n   • Death that occurs while coverage exists = benefit payable\n   • Lapse after death doesn't affect payment of a death that already happened\n\nADDITIONAL LEARNING:\n\nKey Point 1 - Two Types of Death Declaration:\nCourts can declare someone deceased in two circumstances:\n• After unexplained absence (typically 7 years) — death date presumed as date of disappearance\n• During or immediately after circumstances of specific peril (terrorist attack, plane crash, natural disaster) — death date presumed as date of peril\n\nKey Point 2 - Seven-Year Rule Does Not Always Apply:\nWhile a seven-year absence is a general rule for declaring someone dead, a court can declare someone deceased much sooner if there is strong evidence of immediate peril, such as a terrorist attack.\n\nKey Point 3 - Death Benefit Timing:\nOnce the court declares a person dead and establishes the date of death as June 21, 2019, the life insurance policy that was in force on that date must pay the death benefit, even if the policy has since lapsed. The death occurred while covered.\n\nKey Point 4 - Criminal Act Exclusion Does Not Apply:\nThe criminal act exclusion (public policy) applies when the INSURED commits or participates in an illegal activity that causes their own death. Being a victim of terrorism does not trigger this exclusion.\n\n🧠 EXAM KILL RULE:\n\nIf you see:\n• Disaster (plane crash, shipwreck, natural disaster)\n• Terrorist attack\n• Immediate peril event\n• Someone goes missing\n\nAnd:\n• Policy was in force at the time\n\nYour brain should say:\n\"Presumed date of death = date of peril → policy pays\"\n\nIgnore:\n• When the court made the declaration\n• Whether the policy later lapsed\n• The time between disappearance and declaration\n\nFocus on: Was the policy in force when the death is presumed to have occurred?\n\nIf YES → Pay the benefit\nIf NO → Deny the claim",
