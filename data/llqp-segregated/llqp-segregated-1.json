Insurance products (including annuities) qualify as protected when a family class beneficiary (spouse, child, parent, or grandchild) is named. The protection extends to both the commuted value (principal) and ongoing payments. Even though Jake is the contract holder, the beneficiary designation of his wife triggers protection under family class beneficiary rules.

No medical underwriting or health questions are required for segregated fund contracts. Investors with health issues (even severe/shortened life expectancy) can purchase and qualify for full guarantees including 100% death benefit. The death benefit guarantee pays the higher of market value or guaranteed amount to beneficiaries upon death, regardless of age or health.

Brittany, despite her shortened life expectancy, would be accepted normally and receive full 100/100 guarantees (maturity at 10 years plus death benefit anytime).

If a spouse withdraws funds from a spousal RRSP within three calendar years (the year of contribution plus the two previous years) of a contribution, that income is \"attributed\" back to the contributor (Beth) and taxed at her higher rate. This is designed to prevent the exact scenario Beth envisioned: contribute at a high tax rate, withdraw immediately at a low rate. Under Income Tax Act section 146(8.3), if the annuitant (husband) withdraws from any spousal RRSP in the year of contribution or the two preceding calendar years (a 3-year window from the last contribution), the withdrawn amount (up to the contributed amounts in those years) is attributed back to the contributor (Beth) and taxed in her hands at her higher rate. This blocks the \"contribute now, withdraw immediately\" loophole. The husband cannot pull $10,000 right away and pay low tax; it would be taxed to Beth instead. The rule applies to all withdrawals (not just the contributed amount) up to the recent contributions; any excess is taxed to the husband normally. Exceptions include death, relationship breakdown, or certain plans (HBP/LLP withdrawals have separate rules). Beth\u0027s plan to contribute $10,000 and have her husband withdraw $10,000 immediately would trigger full attribution: the $10,000 would be taxed to Beth at her higher rate, eliminating any tax savings. Attribution rules are designed to prevent abuse of certain tax opportunities. In this case, Beth would still be required to report and pay tax on the withdrawal.",

Kristoff received the folder at the time of sale and requested rescission the very next day, clearly within the permitted window. Under provincial insurance acts and CCIR/CLHIA Guideline G2 harmonized standards for segregated funds, rescission works as follows: the investor receives the lesser of the net amount invested (after upfront sales charges) or the current market value at the next valuation point, PLUS the full refund of any front-end load or commission paid. Here, the net invested was $19,200 (after $800 load), but the market dropped to $17,800. Lesser = $17,800. Additionally, the $800 front-end load is refunded separately because the transaction is unwound—the sale is rescinded, and the advisor/insurer does not keep the commission. Total refund: $17,800 (current market value) + $800 (refunded front-end load) = $18,600. This is the SFA exam-specific treatment: rescission refunds the lesser of net invested or market value, PLUS upfront fees separately refunded.

                          "explanation":  "While naming a family class or irrevocable beneficiary usually protects an insurance product from creditors, that protection is void if the transfer is deemed a fraudulent conveyance. Marsha purchased the annuity after a $10,000,000 judgment was already rendered, which signals bad faith and an intent to hinder creditors. Courts can look through the contract and allow creditors to seize the funds. Insurance Act protections are conditional on good faith; they do not shield assets moved after known liabilities arise. This is a classic example of a post-judgment transfer to defeat creditors, so the annuity is not creditor-proof. In short: protected-class and irrevocable beneficiary rules apply only when the purchase is made in good faith, which is not the case here.",
