## ➕ Adding New Questions

### Practice Test MCQ Format

Each MCQ follows this comprehensive JSON structure:

```json
{
  "id": "PPE-001",
  "question": "Your detailed question text here...",
  "options": [
    "A. First option",
    "B. Second option",
    "C. Third option",
    "D. Fourth option"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "optionFeedback": [
    "Feedback for option A (why it's wrong)",
    "Feedback for option B (why it's wrong)",
    "Detailed explanation of why C is correct",
    "Feedback for option D (why it's wrong)"
  ],
  "explanation": "Comprehensive explanation with learning content, real-world examples, legal references, and key concepts to reinforce understanding...",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "tags": ["ethics", "legal", "insurance"]
}
```

### Flashcard Format

Flashcards use a simpler structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "question": "What is the definition of...?",
  "options": [
    "A. First option",
    "B. Second option",
    "C. Third option",
    "D. Fourth option"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "Brief, focused explanation of the correct answer."
}
```

**Key Notes:**
- `id`: For MCQs use `PPE-###` format; flashcards use numbers
- `correctAnswer`: **Zero-indexed** (0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C, 3 = D)
- `optionFeedback`: Array must align with options (MCQs only)
- `explanation`: Comprehensive for MCQs, brief for flashcards
- `difficulty`: `"easy"`, `"medium"`, or `"hard"`
- `tags`: Array of relevant keywords for categorization

   - `data/llqp-ethics/practice-1.json` - Fundamentals (10 questions)
   - `data/llqp-ethics/practice-2.json` - Core concepts (20 questions)
   - `data/llqp-ethics/practice-3.json` - Advanced scenarios (26 questions)

2. **Add your question to the `questions` array**

     "questionCount": 27,  // Update this number
     "dataFile": "data/llqp-ethics/practice-3.json?v=20260205d"
   }
   ```

4. **Test locally** - Open index.html in browser

   ```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Built With
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup with multiple view system
- **CSS3** - Modern responsive design with CSS custom properties
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Zero dependencies, no frameworks
- **LocalStorage API** - Persistent progress and preferences

### Application Architecture

**Single Page Application (SPA) with 4 Main Views:**
1. **Home View** - Topic selection and wrong answer review
2. **Practice Test View** - Select specific test within a topic
3. **MCQ View** - Question interface with navigation
4. **List View** - Overview of all questions (future feature)

**State Management System:**
```javascript
state: {
  topics: [],                    // All available topics
  currentTopic: null,            // Active topic
  currentPracticeTest: null,     // Active test
  questions: [],                 // Current question set
  currentQuestionIndex: 0,       // Active question
  bookmarkedQuestions: Set,      // User flagged questions
  viewedQuestions: Set,          // Visited questions
  answersRevealed: Set,          // Questions with shown answers
  filterMode: 'all',             // 'all' or 'bookmarked'
  wrongQuestions: [],            // Tracked wrong answers
  attemptedOptions: {},          // Track option attempts per question
  firstAttemptCorrect: {},       // First attempt accuracy
  isReviewMode: false            // Wrong answer review state
}
```

### Key Features Implementation

**1. Question Randomization Logic:**
- Questions shuffled **once** using Fisher-Yates algorithm
- Shuffled order saved to localStorage with key: `shuffle_[topicId]_[testId]`
- **Same order maintained** when resuming incomplete tests
- Re-randomization only on "Reset Progress" action
- Answer options also shuffled independently for each question
- Options stripped of A/B/C/D prefix, shuffled, then re-prefixed

**2. Visual Indicator System:**
```css
/* Question dot states */
.is-correct-dot  → Green background + ✓ (::after pseudo-element)
.is-wrong-dot    → Red background + ✗ (::after pseudo-element)
.viewed-dot      → Gray for viewed but unanswered
.current-dot     → Blue for active question
```

**3. Wrong Answer Tracking:**
- Automatically logs incorrect answers with timestamp
- Stored in localStorage: `wrong_questions`
- Each entry: `{ key, topicId, testId, questionId, timestamp }`
- Cross-test review: Loads questions from multiple tests
- "Clear Wrong" button removes questions from current test

**4. Progress Persistence:**
```javascript
// Progress stored per test
localStorage key: `progress_[topicId]_[testId]`
Stored data: {
  viewedQuestions: [],
  bookmarkedQuestions: [],
  answersRevealed: [],
  attemptedOptions: {},
  firstAttemptCorrect: {}
}
```

**5. Dark/Light Mode:**
- Theme stored in localStorage: `theme`
- CSS custom properties for color scheme
- Attribute on `<html>`: `data-theme="dark|light"`
- Toggle icon changes: ☀️ (dark mode) / 🌙 (light mode)

**6. Completion Banner:**
- Shows when all questions answered
- Displays: Correct count / Total questions
- Calculates first-attempt accuracy percentage
- Three action buttons: Main Menu, Back to Tests, Retry Test

- Clear browser cache and hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Q: Progress not saving?**  
A: 
- Ensure localStorage is enabled in browser settings
- Check Privacy/Security settings - localStorage must be allowed
- Try incognito/private mode to test if extensions are interfering

**Q: Questions keep changing order when I resume?**  
A: This should NOT happen. Questions are randomized once and saved. If experiencing this:

- **Hover** over dots for detailed tooltips

**Q: Wrong answer counter not updating?**  
A:
- Wrong answers are logged automatically when you select incorrect option

- Click "Review Wrong Answers" card to practice them
- Use "Clear Wrong" button in a test to remove those questions from review

**Q: Dark mode not working?**  
A:
- Click the 🌙/☀️ icon in top-right corner
- Theme preference saved automatically
- If stuck, clear localStorage and try again

**Q: Bookmarks not saving?**  
A:
- Click the ★ icon on any question to bookmark
- Bookmarks saved per test in localStorage
- Use "Bookmarked" button to filter and view only flagged questions
- Bookmarks persist across sessions

**Q: How do flashcards differ from practice tests?**  
A:
- **Practice Tests:** Full MCQs with option feedback and detailed explanations
- **Flashcards:** Simpler format with brief explanations
- **Purpose:** Flashcards for quick review, practice tests for exam simulation

**Q: Can I export my progress or results?**  
A: Currently not supported. Feature planned for future release.

🔖 **Leverage the Bookmark System**
- Flag questions that challenge you immediately
- Filter to show only bookmarked questions
- Review these regularly until confident
- Remove bookmarks as you master topics

✓ **Track Your Performance**
- Green checkmarks show your strengths - these topics are solid
- Red X marks reveal weak areas - focus study time here
- Review wrong answers using the dedicated review system
- Aim for 100% green before moving to next test

❌ **Master Wrong Answers**
- Use "Review Wrong Answers" card on home screen
- Questions from ALL tests appear in review mode
- Once you get a question right, remove it from review
- "Clear Wrong" button removes current test's mistakes

📊 **Monitor First-Attempt Accuracy**
- Completion banner shows first-try score
- This metric indicates exam readiness
- Aim for 85%+ first-attempt accuracy
- Re-take tests after studying to improve score

🎯 **Read Everything Carefully**
- Study the explanation even when you answer correctly
- Review option feedback for wrong choices
- Understand WHY each option is correct/incorrect
- Context and reasoning matter more than memorization

🔄 **Don't Reset Too Early**
- Complete all questions before resetting progress
- Resetting randomizes questions again

- Reset only when ready for fresh practice

💡 **Use Both Formats**
- **Practice Tests:** Deep learning with detailed explanations

- Alternate between formats for variety
- Flashcards great for review sessions

📝 **Take Notes Externally**
- Copy complex explanations to your notes
- Create summary sheets by topic
- Write out concepts in your own words
- Teaching others reinforces your understanding

⏰ **Create a Study Schedule**
- 20-30 minutes daily better than cramming
- Review wrong answers each session
- Mix practice tests and flashcards
- Take breaks every 45-60 minutes

🎯 **Exam Simulation**
- Complete a full practice test without pausing
- Don't reveal answers until finished
- Time yourself (though timer not built-in yet)
- Treat it like the real exam

### Pre-Exam Checklist
